## Course Overview

This page focuses on the course _9.00_ _Introduction to Psychology_ as it was taught by Prof. John Gabrieli in Spring 2011.

_Introduction to Psychology_ is designed to introduce you to the scientific study of human nature.

The class divides into twelve recitation sessions to discuss course topics each week.
