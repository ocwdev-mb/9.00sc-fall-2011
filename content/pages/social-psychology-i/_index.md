What is social psychology? What is the relationship between attitude and behavior? In this lesson, we will study how the people around us influence our feelings, thoughts, and behaviors, and learn "how funny we are as humans in our desire to fit in." We also will go over two of the most famous experiments in psychology: the Stanford Prison Experiment and the Milgram Obedience Experiment.

› _Sample answer_

{{< /div-with-class >}}{{< div-with-class "toggle1">}}

Conformity is when someone changes beliefs or behavior due to how other people around them are behaving. This may be due to believing the other people's beliefs and behavior are more accurate or appropriate, or it may be due to wanting to be liked by others. Asch's line experimented conformity by having confederates give incorrect answers about the comparable length of two lines. When confederates gave the wrong answer, participants were more likely to conform and give an obviously incorrect answer.

Obedience is when people conform to those in authority. Obedience does not need to occur due to believing a person's actions are correct. Obedience is demonstrated in Milgram's shock experiment. People obeyed the experimenter and continue to increase the strength of an electric shock given to another participant to the point of extreme pain. There was actually no shock or other participant.
